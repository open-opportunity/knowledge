# Training

The planned delivery of information that is tailored to a schedule of learning or curriculum; as opposed to being tailored to an individual.

Delivery can be didactic or through media - or a combination thereof. Delivery may take the form of a lecture, workshop, or seminar etc.

Customisation may be involved via the addition or subtraction of modules or learning units.

Learning units themselves are created to offer a generic and broadly applied opportunities to learn. Leaning units do not need to be context aware, though they may have depth enough to serve multiple common contexts that are known at the time of creation or modification.

Any particular delivery cycle consumes a fixed version of the material - and material is not modified from within the training process itself.

Delivery can be entirely digital or through media, and the learner may be able to consume the training material independently and at their own pace.

Training my involve formative assessment via the use of testing against pre-established metrics. These tests form part of the body of training material itself.

## Trainer

A person who contributes to the delivery of Training Material.

A Trainer may contribute to the creation of material by offering critique, or by collating and describing the outcome of research.

A Trainer may create additional delivery material by making recordings - either audio or video - as a proxy to in person or live delivery.

A Trainerâ€™s core contribution to creation learning material is through their expertise in delivery and media - though they may have additional responsibilities as subject matter experts. This expertise may be the result of specific research, leveraging subject matter experts, or it may come from direct experience in context.

# Mentoring

The planned delivery of information that is tailored to an individual and the context of their learning needs; as opposed to a schedule of learning or curriculum.

Delivery will often be with an awareness of training material - but may offer improved accuracy and specificity, and will bring the knowledge created elsewhere into context.

Delivery will often capture the inefficiencies and inaccuracies of training material or training delivery - and can create a benefit loop with feedback to earlier processes where relevant.

Delivery will be live and interactive.

Delivery is positioned as non-authoritative leadership in learning, and in particular identifying accountability and opportunities in learning.

Providing learning through example and replication.

Consultation regarding the context of learning and problems that a Mentee is exposed to.

## Mentor

A person that contributes to the contextualisation of learning, and the practical application thereof.

A Mentor is not a position of seniority - though, it is not incompatible with seniority.

A Mentor is a subject matter expert with direct experience of the application of a particular process, role, duty, or area of knowledge.

A Mentor may provide instruction for the express intention of learning - but otherwise does not give instruction or provide instructional authority and sign off by virtue of mentorship.

They may provide instruction and instructional authority and sign-off by virtue of their other roles and responsibilities.

A Mentor may be accountable to instructions given during direct supervision, but accountability by virtue of mentorship ought to dissipate proportionately, and instructional authority and sign-off should be established through other channels of management and leadership.

A Mentor is always accountable to their professionalism and integrity - but may identify opportunities to take risks to their Mentee that they are not accountable for.

A Mentor may have general accountability by virtue of any framework or policy they are acting under, or any particular or specific terms that create accountability that describe their role and capacity as a Mentor.

### Types of Mentor

**Career or Discipline**

A career mentor offers guidance in your particular career path, or in the area of discipline employed in your work or business.

They can be colleagues, alumni, or industry peers. Importantly, they could do (and likely have already done) exactly what they are advising you to do. They may have taken a parallel path or one that forked in a different direction at a more senior junction.

They may create value for you because they have been able to observe their own peers, and can probably seek out their own learning to support the context you're in by leveraging their experiences and relationships.

**Personal**

A Personal Mentor offers you guidance in your personal life. The context of the accountability, challenge, and perspective they offer is to facilitate growth in your life outside of your work day, your career, and your business.

A Personal Mentor can be further broken down into Relationship and Spiritual mentorship - which outlines popular areas of specialism.

Relationship Mentors may focus actual or potential romantic or sexual relationships, or my focus on familial or other types of social interaction.

Spiritual Mentors my offer guidance into a particular religious or spiritual discipline, or offer more broad nondenominational input that focuses on existential understanding.

# Coaching

Challenged introspection and reflection.

# Championing

This skillset is important as it is often interwoven with Training, Mentoring, and Coaching.

Our champion seeks to render a service to our ideas and goals. They actively remove friction, they traverse gatekeepers, make introductions, warm up potential leads, and otherwise ensure a less hostile interactions.

The rewards for a champion are accolade, status, future connection, or the satisfaction of intrinsics reward.

# Investor

An investor provides resource and takes risk in exchange for reward. Supporting you has a cost to them, money and work are their currency.

If they offer you a favour, it is one that would create an actual cost to them. Making connections in their already established network is the favour of a champion. Getting their team to build something to help you get started, or doing work that they would regularly and ordinarily charge for, is the favour of an Investor.

Of course, money or credit for services in exchange for established shares, or that will be repaid in the future, or in exchange for an agreed level of service to be returned is not a favour but an explicit transaction (however informal).
