# Hygiene

Hygiene is very important to consider in *Personal Development* - which is a concept that is familiar to most as a topic that explores practical cleanliness.

In being hyginenic, or practicing good hygiene, we limit how vulnerble we are to disease.

It has long been thought that good hygiene contributes to an improved mental health in the form of *self-care* - so in addition to the direct health benefits, and the indirect social benefits (in as much as poor hygiene will likely impact your social standing), we *may* find that maintaining sufficent discipline to avoid descructive behaviours and poor hygiene is good for our overall well-being.

The traditional view of hygiene focuses on preventing the spread, introduction, or development of disease causing organisms in or on the body, or in the enviroment in which we live.

It encompases rituals, practices, and other behaviour elements that permeate our physical experience.

Likewise, we can also extend the concept of hygiene to offer value in other specific realms of our experience.

We can observe our behaviours and relation to various other ideas that cause impact, and we can actively avoid those unhygienic patterns and opt to create or engage with more hygienic rituals.

## Motivational Hygiene

The avoidance of those patterns that are distructive to our motivation.

## Emotional Hygiene

To adoption of or integration of ideas that do not limit our emotional experience, that ensure that are emotionally informed, and that we avoid being emotionally lead.

## Social Hygiene

The standards and etiquette in our relationships that ensure that those relationships are not damaged by faulty rituals or poorly managed expecation.

## Spiritual Hygiene

The pursuit of and engagement with ideas that are spiritually grounded.
