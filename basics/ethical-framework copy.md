# Ethical Guidelines

A Service Provider's core ethical challange is to remove themselves, or limit and reduce how embedded they may become in the development of those they support.

A Trainer should seek to ensure that training content and curricula have clear end goals; which upon completion bring about a natural end to the dependancy of learning. Extensive training content should be well sectioned, with junctures that allows for an exit that confers benefit to a Trainee at whichever level an exit is taken - such as leveling that describes the transition from novice, through to competence, to expertise, and so on.

A Mentor should seek to ensure that not only is *Context of Work* transfered to their Mentee - but that perspective, decision making, engagement, and anaylyical skills are developed appropriately. A Mentee should *grauduate* from the guidence of a Mentor once a discipline has been honed, and the goal of independance should be asired to.

A Coach can assume a long term arrangement with a Coachee, due to the core engagement being accountability and challange - which are two facets of continual development that persist regardless of past success or achievement attained. The level of engagment, however, hinges on the balance between the Coachee having personal accountabiltiy and individual thirst for challange, and having the locus of instigation being with the Coach.

A Service Provider MUST NOT over subscribe direct services and should strive to maximise the value that they offer to each Service User.
