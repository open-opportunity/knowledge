# TMC Service Framework

TMC stands for `Training`, `Mentoring` and `Coaching`, and the TMC Service Framework is structured in this order with purpose.

It’s important to note here that development is an issue concerning skill – not motivation or behaviour.

It is also worthy to note that an incentive does not produce skill, maintain skill, or increase it.

Personal and Professional Development (PPD) is a process of increasing potential. Physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual growth all add to potential; and though one might focus on a single area, all four are important for balance.

A Service Provider SHOULD determine which type of service is needed, and MUST do so via a process of colaboration. Once a need as been identified, the Service Provider MUST consider their BOTH their ability to provide a service AND whether or not they SHOULD provide that service (see [Ethical Framework](ethical-framework.md)).

During any of these phases a Service Provider will look to identify *friction* - such as limiting behaviours and thinking patterns. The OOF considers such *friction* and the resulting need to challange as a complimentary/companion service.

## Cause for Development

We must first discover that there is cause for development. This includes identifying a gap in skill and also a need to fill it.

A mere gap in skill doesn't always establish a need for supported development. Without a business, career, or personal need to overcome such gaps, there is little justification to commit the required resources. This is not to say that a Service User must be discurraged from investing time in these areas - far from it, the Service User's independance is important. It is, however, important that a chargable service offering ought to focus on valud addition - so it would be rare for a Servie Provider to directly support efforts that don't achieve an appropriate value assessment.

It is important then, that a Service Provider understands the scope of their involvment in a client's development - and that the Service Provider is aware of any undesirable dependancy.

## The Flow

The Service Framework has a start, middle and an end. You must rule out steps that are not required, as well as aim to move forward to the next if needed.

One must always start from the beginning during any particular assessment.

* Step one: training
* Step two: mentoring
* Step three: coaching

Each of these steps has entirely different functions but unfortunately they are often mixed up. In some working cultures, training and coaching are used interchangeably – they are more useful if they remain distinct. In OOF worldview, not only do these engagements operate differently, but they also require independent initiatives to ensure they perform; and different metrics to determine their success.

### Training

Training is all about acquiring the skills you want. Lets use an employee as an example: a new employee needs training when they arrive at their job. A more experienced employee may need training when a new product, service or process is introduced – or after periods of extended absence. The same can be said of anyone wishees to aquire or improve on their skillsets.

If a person doesn’t have a particular skill or skillset, they need training.

Training involves Experts transferring expertise, sometimes via the proxy of a Trainer – ideally the Trainer is the Expert. Training is not just about reading the manual and getting on with it. Training requires someone that can put energy and life in to information that can on occasion be quite dull material and importantly: the appropriate perspective and ancilary information that doesn't find its way into the books.

One should distinguish between Training and Study. The former being a type of Supported Learning and the latter being performed independantly of any intervention.

### Mentoring

Mentoring is all about context. Now that you have aquired a skill, you'll need to apply it and utilise it in some context or other.

In relation to working environments in which Mentorships can be found - you’ll be surprised to hear, that the best Mentors are NOT managers! Professionl Mentorship is about learning the job, and making sense of all your new-found but often completely misplaced know-how. A Mentor doesn’t just show you how to do your job; they show you how THEY do it.

Where do the habits come from? Where does the voice of experience come from? Who says, “Don’t worry about that, just give it a kick and it’ll start back up again”? - A mentor that’s who.

Crucially, this tells us something about how to pick a Mentor. A good Mentor ought to be a good and worthy example of someone who is able to exploy their skillset in a way that create quality, expediency, and ethically abidable.

Personality is often a good indicator for Mentors. A friendly voice, caring smile, and a patient disposition go a long way.

### Coaching

You now know what you're doing. Moreover, you can apply this knowldge in context and with suitable competence.


Coaching is all about getting more.

An important thing to remember here is that Coaching is about self-development. It is not the job of the Coach to tell their Service User how to do their job, or to correct them on the application of their skill; it’s to ask them if they can do it better. A coach says, “Do you have everything you need?” or, “Are you performing at your best?”

The role of a Coach centres on engagement. Very often, the role is perverted in to one of pushing and cajoling someone in to doing better. This then leads to *Remotely Instigated Performance*, which means – the Coach instigates the improvement, not the individual. Consequently, if you remove the coach, you remove the improvements. In sure, there is a dependancy.

Helping someone engage is achieved by exploring their intrinsic motivators and using them to encourage internal changes. It’s about saying, “What’s holding you back?” or “What would it take for you to raise your game?”

Coaching is about taking an experienced and knowledgeable person and helping them to become Experts.

## Recap

If you would like to change skill level, you need to Train, Mentor, and Coach.

If, however, you would like to change behaviour you need to use incentive.

* Stage One: Training
  * Acquiring or increasing skill
* Stage Two: Mentoring
  * Acquiring experience in using skills in context
* Stage Three: Coaching
  * Increasing expertise

When you decide that an individual needs development, you put them in to the appropriate category:

They either **do not have the right skills**, thus need **training**;

Or, they are struggling to put their **skills into practice**, thus need **mentoring**;

Or, they have come to a head with their development and have **stopped progressing on their own**, thus need **coaching** to lift them through their glass ceiling.

Supplanting one aspect for another, coaching in exchange for training for instance, only weakens the process of development. Training someone when they need to be coached wastes resources, time and growth opportunity.

Always be sure of what stage of development is required; as an individual this requires self-awareness.
