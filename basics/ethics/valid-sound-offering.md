# Valid and Sound Offering

Throughout providing a *Service* lots of ideas are communicated, they can be:

* Shared
* Promoted
* Sold

We *share* ideas when we communicate them but provide no emphasis on their validity or value; we *promote* ideas when we attach value and state or imply validity; and we *sell ideas* when exchange ideas for benefit - or we attach ideas as contingent to benefit being created.

In order to provide an **Ethical Service** the ideas that we *promote* or *sell* ought to be either **Valid** or **Sound**. For this reason a *Service Provider* should strongly prefer ***Evidence Based Practice***.

## The Benefit of Sharing

Not all ideas ought to pass the rigours of an evidence base, peer reviewed research, or meta analysis. There is benefit created beyond the mere transmission of fact in the form of narrative, story morals, exposition, analogy, the creation of empathy, and so on.

A skilled story teller can support the suspension of disbelief in order to entertain, or to cause an audience to consume a novel perspective. A fictional world can present opportunities to create characters that experience fear, or jealousy, or forgiveness - and all manner of other human conditions - and yet, once the context and situtaion are dispensed with
