# Valid and Sound Offering

Throughout providing a *Service* lots of ideas are communicated, they are either:
* Shared
* Promoted
* Sell

We *share* ideas when we provide no emphasis on it's validity or value, we *promote* ideas when we attach value and state or imply validity, and we *sell ideas* when exchange ideas for benefit - or we attach ideas as contingent to benefit being created.
