# Ethical Guidelines

A Service Provider's core ethical challange is to remove themselves, or limit and reduce how embedded they may become in the development of those they support.

A Trainer should seek to ensure that training content and curricula have clear end goals; which upon completion bring about a natural end to the dependancy of learning. Extensive training content should be well sectioned, with junctures that allows for an exit that confers benefit to a Trainee at whichever level an exit is taken - such as leveling that describes the transition from novice, through to competence, to expertise, and so on.

A Mentor should seek to ensure that not only is *Context of Work* transfered to their Mentee - but that perspective, decision making, engagement, and anaylyical skills are developed appropriately. A Mentee should *grauduate* from the guidence of a Mentor once a discipline has been honed, and the goal of independance should be aspired to.

A Coach will often assume a long term arrangement with a Coachee, due to the core engagement being *accountability* and *challange* - which are two facets of *Continual Development* that persist regardless of past success or achievement attained. The level of engagment, however, hinges on the balance between the Coachee having personal accountabiltiy and individual thirst for challange, and having the locus of instigation being with the Coach.

A Service Provider MUST NOT over subscribe direct services and should strive to maximise the value that they offer to each Service User.

## Conflict of Interest

Conflict of Interest arrises when any pecuniary, business, or personal interests directly or indirectly conflicts with the best interest of the Service User.

Conflict of Interest can also arise when the same interests impact the abiltiy of the Service Provider to provide the Service; either under the terms of which the Service is offered, or the effecay of the Service itself.

Secondary Conflict of Interest can arise when the same or similar interests are held by someone other than the Service Provider, but who are otherwise associated with them - such as relations, friends, or the relations or friends of those they are connected with.

This includes, but it not limited to:

* Where the Service Provider is able to create influence in the Service User to create material differences in the interests of the Service Provider, or the interest of a connected third party
* Where the Service User unknowingly provides insight to the benefit of those other interests that the Service Provider might have
* Where the Service Provider stands to profit from a transaction - a benefit which the Service Provider is either unaware, or unreasonably believes is a necessary transaction for their own benefit or in order to benefit from the Service

A Service Provider MUST disclose both the party and nature of benefit which is created by the Conflict of Interest as soon as possible.

If either the party or nature of benefit is known in advance / prior to any terms that are entered into - then the Servive Provider MUST ensure that disclosure happens before commencement.

Where a Service creates multilple opportunities for engagement over a prolongned period of time, the Service Provider MUST consider Conflict of Interest at the commencement of each engagement.

A Service Provider MUST always consider AND notify the Service User if there are grounds to withhold transparency regarding the party or nature of benefit or potential benefit - for example, where an NDA prevents full disclosure.

In order to prevent Conflict of Interest creating impact, a Service Provider MUST consider the options of:

* Recusal around specific issues or particular interventions
* Termination or curtailment of Service

Where possible, the Service Provider SHOULD provide details of interests in any *Welcome Pack* or make this information available on marketing or promotional material - including websites and printed media.

The Service Provider MUST avail themselves of the understanding that a commitment to the interest of the Service User takes precidence over ALL other interests, parties, or opportunities - and the Service Provider MUST disengage where they cannot make such a commitment.

## Confidentiality and Limitations

Confidentiality MUST be assumed in all engagements.

A Service Provider MUST ensure that personal information is protected and remains undisclosed to any party without the express consent of the Service User.

A Service Provider MUST comply with ALL laws regarding data protection, and SHOULD adopt and comply with the strictest law / protection available if their Service spans multiple jurisdictions.

A Service Provider MUST maintain the nature of confidentiality.

A Service Provider MUST respect that the requirements relating to confidentiality continue after an engagement has ended, regardless for the reason that an engagement came to a close.

Where a Service Provider sees fit to seek out external support for an engagement, the Service Provider MUST exercise the greatest prudence on matters pertaining to the Service User where advice or guidance is sought.

The Service Provider MUST ensure that all information regarding the Service User is treated with the utmost respect and confidence - including but not limited to:

* Personal Identifable Inforamtion
* Decision making (either the results or methods used)
* Alegences
* Financial position
* Relationships (the nature of, or the parties involved)

A Service Provider MUST ensure that all confidential material are held and disposed of appropriately.

## Consent

A Service Provider MUST ensure that *consent* is a core tenant in any Service that is offered - and that the Service User remains competent and well-informed such that *consent* is fully opperational at all times.

A Service Provider MUST explicitly notify a Service User when *consent* is required, how it is established, and ensure that they are aware of the right to, and empowered to act on, the ability to withdraw *consent* - and ensure that this continues throughout any engagement regarding any and all matters that are appropriate.

## Informed Client

A Services Providers MUST ensure that their Clients are well informed, and to do so in a timely manor.
