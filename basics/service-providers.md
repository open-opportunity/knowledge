# Service Providers

A Service Provider is considered to be someone who seeks to apply this Knoweldge Base in pursuit of helping or supporting others. This Knowledge Base is written for the use of Service Providers in order to create as a strong foundaation in their efforts to create valued Services.

It is hoped that this Knowledge Base will also be useful to those who aren't offering Services in a professional capcity, but who nonetheless have the good fortune and privilage of being trusted by their social, familial, or profesional network, to offer guidence and support to others.

It is important that a Service Provider - especially one who is registered and working profesionally - understand and be able to correctly utiliise the understanding that each area of Service is distinct and has differings needs.

A Trainer or Mentor MUST be appropriately skilled, experienced, or qualified in the area that they are offering a Service in - that is, in addition to any qualification or experience with this Knowledge Base.

A Coach MUST appropriately comparmentalise any Training and Mentoring needs that their Service User might have - and not attempt to inappropriately satisfy them.

All Trainers, Mentors, and Coaches SHOULD make appropriate referals.

To recap, a Service Provider:

* MAY offer Services independantly or embeded in an organsiation
  * Such organisations may be direct service provision, or any that support their employees through a provision
* MAY be a Trainer, Mentor, or a Coache
  * MAY be a combination thereof
* MUST be able to differenciate services
* SHOULD make appropriate referals

## Service Users

We use the terms `Service Users` to mean anyone who reciveved Training, Mentorying, or Coaching. We also use the term `Client` to refer to Service Users whose engement is solely one of the Services.

An employee in a widget production company may be a Service User, by recieving Training, Mentoring, or Coaching through their employeer, their line management, or however a business might support their team.

An individual who seeks direct support, or support from a Trainer, Mentor, or Coach who is not part of their employing business - or who provides Services indipendantly of any emplyoment - is a Client.
